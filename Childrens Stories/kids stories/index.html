            <h3>The Moral</h3>
            <p>From this story what we learn is ,Drama Artist lose his valuable Diamond into the deep sea,like him  we should not lose our soul.
                Because our soul is very important for everybody.
                If we do the sin and lose our soul into satan, Our life is waste.
                we have to keep the soul with out sin.
                Unfortunately or unkownly if we do the sin,the only way is Lord jesus.
                He is the one and only God, he who victory the satan.
            </p>

                </blockquote>
